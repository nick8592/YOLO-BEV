# YOLO-BEV

A perception pipeline for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that combines YOLO-based 2D object detection with 3D bounding box estimation and Bird's Eye View (BEV) transformation using nuScenes front-camera images.

## Project Proposal

For detailed information about the pipeline architecture, methodology, and implementation plan, see [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md).

## Quick Start

*Coming soon - implementation in progress*

## Features

- Monocular 3D object detection from front-camera images
- YOLO-powered 2D detection with 3D regression
- BEV transformation for spatial planning
- Real-time performance optimized for ADAS applications
